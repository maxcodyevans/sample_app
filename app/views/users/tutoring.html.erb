<h1>K-12 Tutoring</h1>


<br/><br/>

<h3>Why an Erudito Tutor?</h3>
We offer private in-home tutoring for all grade levels. We understand that learning is highly affected by teacher-student interaction, thus carefully place tutors to meet the individual needs of each student. Our tutors have a variety of backgrounds in different subjects, including math, science, literature, and English. Any subject can be taught in English in order to cater to Ecuadorâ€™s bi-lingual schools.

<h3>Here are some things to consider before requesting a tutor for a student in grades k-12:</h3>

<li>What kind of learning style does my child have? Is he/she a visual learner, interactive learner, or a traditional learner?</li>
